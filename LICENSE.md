This educational work is provided free of charge for anyone in the world to make use of.  I didn't create it to make money, but rather because scientific education is important.  If you want to have any of it for yourself, please help yourself to it by downloading it.

This is also provided free in a second sense: you are free to use and/or modify _all_ of the material which I have written, _except_ anywhere where another author is named (e.g. most photographs), under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).  This kind of freedom is often termed _copyleft_. You are particularly welcome to use my materials for educational purposes.

In detail, this means that you are free to share (copy, distribute and transmit), and to remix (adapt and change) the materials and resources, so long as you attribute me as the author (but not in any way that suggests that I endorse you or your use of them), you do not use them for commercial purposes, and if you alter, transform, or build upon them, you may distribute the resulting works only under the same or similar license to this one.

This in no way diminishes my right, which I assert, to be identified as the author of those materials and resources on this site which I have written, in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

## Examples of crediting

Ask yourself whether an interested viewer/reader/listener/other user is able to easily see that I wrote the original, and the freedoms associated with that (license notice). If they can, great!
