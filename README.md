graphs
===========

This repository contains some graphs which are useful in A-level physics.

AQA require a number knowledge of graphs in a fair amount of detail.  This is an attempt to produce revisable graphs with the appropriate level of detail / guidance.

The code and notes were written by Andrew C. Norman (Physics Department, Radley College).
