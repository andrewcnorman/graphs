    "## The shape of the black-body curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of black-body curves is given by the Planck radiation law, which gives the energy density as a fuction of wavelength (the Stefan&ndash;Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law follow immediately from it: by integrating over all $\\lambda$ and finding the peak value of $\\lambda$ respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Planck in 1901 published an equation which fitted the experimental results for black-body radiation, but he could only derive it by quantizing the vibrations allowed in the oscillators within such bodies.  This, together with Einstein's paper quantizing light in 1905, established *quantum theory*, a cornerstone of modern physics.\n",
