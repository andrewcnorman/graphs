The electrons are scattered by the electric force field of the nucleus, and re-emerge with no loss of kinetic energy.  This is described by particle physics as a coherent interaction of virtual photons (mediating the electromagnetic force) with the nucleus as a whole, and thus it provides a probe of the global properties of the nucleus, such as its charge radius.\n",

This means that they produce a diffraction pattern with the first minimum at $$\\sin\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D},$$ where $D$ is the diameter of the sphere\n",

    "## In search of a better fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The scattering of beams of particles by nuclei is at heart an important class of question, which can be solved by means of quantum mechanics.  The problem is one in which a substance contains $n$ scattering centres of force per unit volume.  A particle moves through the substance, and we wish to know the probability, per length $x$ of its path, that the particle is scattered through and angle $\\theta$ into the solid angle $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the important case where the potential $V(r) = Z_1Z_2e^2/r=-\\alpha/r$, corresponding to the non-relativistic scattering of particles of charge $Z_1$ ($Z_1=2$ for $\\alpha$ particles, $Z_1=-1$ for electrons) by a bare nucleus of charge $Z_2e$, quantum mechanics gives the same formula as classical mechanics (this happens in this case alone):\n",

    "\n",
    "For a more general field $V(r)$, or in the case where the wavelengths of the virtual photons of the EM interaction are not much larger than the radius of the proton, each small element of volume of the scattering potential scatters waves, the subsequent amplitudes of which must be summed over the potential extent in order to find the scattering cross section at a particular point.  This is very difficult, and so approximate methods are used, for example in the case of high energy electrons, the approximate method of finding the scattering probability is known as the *Born approximation* (it is in essence just the use of the first-order $\\bra{\\psi_f}V(r)\\ket{\\psi_i}$ term in the perturbation theory expansion, i.e. assuming that the incident wave is not seriously distorted by the scattering potential).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Born approximation fails, a more accurate method is needed to solve the scattering problem.  One such method, applicable to a spherically symmetrical potential, is to expand the wave function into partial waves and use a *phase shift analysis* to account for the distortion of the incident wave by the scattering potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Born approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "For nuclei of small $A$ (and therefore small nuclear charge and scattering potential), the Born approximation is capable of giving a reasonably good account of the measured $\\mathrm{d}\\sigma/\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$, with good agreement with the data except near the diffraction minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Account is taken of the ultrarelativistic nature of the electrons by using free particle eigenfunctions obtained from the Dirac equation, instead of the Schrödinger equation, to evaluate the matrix elements entering into the Born approximation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mott scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "If Rutherford scattering is the low-energy limit of $\\mathrm{e^-p}$ scattering when $E\\ll m_{\\mathrm{e}}$ (so the electron is non-relativistic), then Mott scattering is the limit of electon&ndash;proton scattering where the electron is relativistic but the proton recoil still can be neglected, i.e. $m_\\mathrm{p}\\ll E\\ll m_\\mathrm{e}$. (NB $m_\\mathrm{p}=\\SI{938.3}{MeV}$.) The cross section is again calculated from first-order perturbation theory for a point-like object with potential $V(r)=-\\alpha/r$ as\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\Omega}\\right)_\\mathrm{Mott}=\\frac{\\alpha}{4E^2\\sin^4\\frac{\\theta}{2}}\\cos^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this doesn't change the fit to our Carbon data that much: the fit is still in good agreement with the data for low angles, and quite significantly above the measured data for angles above the first diffraction minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Form factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to introduce a *form factor*, to account for the fact that the charge distribution is not point-like, as we have so far assumed, but instead has a finite extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross section for a point-like scatterer is modified by a form factor, so the final scattering cross section is expressed as a product of the cross section for a point-like target multiplied by the square of the form factor:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\Omega}=\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\Omega}\\right)_\\mathrm{point-like}\\lvert F(\\theta)\\rvert^2$$\n",

    "$$F(\\theta)=\\left[ \\frac{ 2J_{1}(ka\\sin\\theta) }{ ka\\sin\\theta } \\right].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The form factor accounts for phase differences between contributions to the scattered wave from different points of the charge distribution (note that these phase differences, and thus departure of the form factor from the point-like target form, will be larger for larger scattering angles, and this explains the better fit of the Mott distrubution at lower angles).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Phase differences motivating the form factor in elastic scattering](electrondiffraction/phasedifference.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wavelength of the electron is much larger than the radius of the nucleus, the contributions to the scattered wave from each point in the charge distribution will be in phase and therefore add constuctively.  When the wavelength is smaller than the radius of the nucleus (and this must be the case for our electrons, in order for them to be able to probe nuclear structure), the phases of the scattered waves will have a strong dependence on the positions of the part of the charge distribution responsible for the scattering.  In this case, when integrated over the entire charge distribution, the negative interference between different contributions greatly reduces the total amplitude.\n",

    "The above description of the basic formulae of the electron-scattering process is only an approximate one. More exact methods of finding the scattering cross section have been developed, employing the *phase-shift* methods.  These more exact methods are applicable to heavy nuclei as well as light ones.\n",

Nevertheless, quantitative results definitely require the more elaborate phase-shift methods and simple, and in this case, closed formulae cannot be given to describe the scattering cross section."
