    "\n",
    "Elastic scattering of electrons from nuclei gives a measure of the size of the nuclear charge distribution.  The electrons are scattered by the electric force field of the nucleus, and re-emerge with no loss of kinetic energy.  This is described by particle physics as a coherent interaction of virtual photons (mediating the electromagnetic force) with the nucleus as a whole, and thus it provides a probe of the global properties of the nucleus, such as its charge radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons are an ideal probe because \n",
    "- they interact via the electromagnetic force\n",
    "- they are not absorbed by the nucleus\n",
    "- the electromagnetic force is weak (compared to the nuclear force between nucleons), so the electron easily penetrates into the nucleus\n",
    "- electron beams of very high intensity can be made and used (meaning decent measurements can be made even for angles where there is a low probability of scattering)\n"
